RunMe.pyc compiles the all the files for the mod.
It pulls information about advisors form input.csv.
That csv is formated as:
Name in Code; English Localization; German Localization; French Localization; Spanish Localization; Mod From; Point Type; Modifier Name in code; Modifier Value
Note: Localization are not entirely required if left out then a blank space will be left where they would go in the text and users should still be able to determine which advisor the event is for based on their name.
Note: While it says Language 5;Language 6;Language 7;ect those are for future use in case anyone wants to do some translations in the localization methods for me.

Note: If an advisor has multiple modifiers then separate each modifier name and value with a space.

Several options to change the properties of the mod in config.cfg.

After all desired changes are made in input and config run RunMe.pyc to generate all required files for this mod.  
Finally copy generated common, events, and localisation folders into your mod.
